### Lab 6 by Bohdan Shybetskyi

I used weather API from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/current).

To run the project you need:

1. Visit [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/api) website and sign up.
2. Generate your own api key.
3. Paste the key into `script.js` file:
4. Launch index.html in a browser.
5. Done
